# Pop-up Message Script

## Overview
This script continuously displays a pop-up message that says **"I am an idiot"**. The message box will keep reappearing until the user clicks the **"Yes"** button.

It uses the `tkinter` library in Python to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the message box.

## How It Works
- When you run the script, a pop-up will appear with the message **"I am an idiot"** and two options: **Yes** and **No**.
- If the user clicks **No** or closes the window, the pop-up will reappear.
- The loop will continue until the user clicks **Yes**, at which point the script will exit.

## Requirements
To run this script, you need:
- **Python** (preferably version 3.6 or higher)
- The **tkinter** library (comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)

### Installation of Python
If you don't already have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing tkinter
On most systems, `tkinter` comes pre-installed with Python. If you are using a minimal installation of Python, you may need to install it manually. Here's how:

- **On Ubuntu/Debian**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    ```

- **On Windows/Mac**:
    `tkinter` should already be included, but if it's not, reinstall Python and make sure to include the `tkinter` module during installation.

**Run the Script**:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the folder where you saved the Python script.
    - Run the script by typing:
      ```bash
      python popup_message.py

**Interact with the Pop-up**:
    - The pop-up window will display with the message **"I am an idiot"** and buttons **Yes** and **No**.
    - If you click **No** or close the window, it will reappear.
    - Click **Yes** to exit the loop and close the script.

## Important Notes
- This script is **annoying** by design, as it continually displays the pop-up until the user clicks "Yes."
- Use this script responsibly and avoid running it on systems where it could cause inconvenience to others.

## Disclaimer
This script is meant for educational or entertainment purposes. Running it on someone else's system without their permission is unethical and could be considered disruptive behavior.

By using this script, you agree not to cause any harm or disruption to other users or systems.
