# scripts-mal

Welcome, This collection of scripts is designed for pranks, fun, and lighthearted hacking activities. These scripts are meant to amuse, confuse, or annoy, but they are **safe** and **harmless**â€”please **use responsibly** and **only with consent**.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find small, playful scripts, primarily in Python, that you can use to prank your friends, learn programming tricks, or simply amuse yourself. These scripts may simulate system behaviors, like pop-ups or mouse movements, that can be funny or surprising, but they do **not** cause any harm to your system or data.

**Note**: Always make sure to use these scripts ethically and with permission from the person you're pranking.
